  Warnings:

  - The primary key for the `Comment` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - The `id` column on the `Comment` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - The primary key for the `RefreshToken` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - The `id` column on the `RefreshToken` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - The primary key for the `Ticket` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - The `id` column on the `Ticket` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - The `assignedToId` column on the `Ticket` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - The primary key for the `User` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - The `id` column on the `User` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - A unique constraint covering the columns `[ticketNumber]` on the table `Ticket` will be added. If there are existing duplicate values, this will fail.
  - Changed the type of `ticketId` on the `Comment` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
  - Changed the type of `authorId` on the `Comment` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
  - Changed the type of `userId` on the `RefreshToken` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
  - Changed the type of `createdById` on the `Ticket` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
